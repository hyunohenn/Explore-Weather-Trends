### Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions
My goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I’ll follow the steps below:

- **Extract the data** from the database.  I’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live. To interact with the database, I'll need to write a SQL query.
    - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
    - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

- **Open up the CSV** 
  
- **Create a line chart** that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable 
  
- **Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
